# Main Takeaways 46 Days into Prompting

After 46 days of prompting LLMs and the release of Archetype 0.1, here are my main takeaways:

- LLMs surpass human intelligence by a significant margin. It's crucial to recognize that LLMs already encompass ALL the knowledge we have. Viewing them as inferior to individual intelligence limits our exploration of their potential. Computer engineers have created an incredible technology (grateful for them), but they don't fully comprehend its possibilities due to its specialization in practical domains.

- The key challenge is unlocking their potential. Rather than focusing solely on technical knowledge, we should aim to elevate our communication skills to match LLMs'. Currently, we lack a clear understanding of how to achieve this. The good analogy would be us trying to communicate with ET. The simpler our prompts, the less likely we'll discover their true potential.

- To glimpse into their potential, prompts must strive for both quantity and quality.

- Anyone can prompt LLMs. You don't need to learn artificial languages, e.g. Python, for that. Prompts are based on natural language. In fact, the most successful prompters are domain experts. By engaging LLMs with your domain knowledge, you'll uncover avenues to explore their profound depths.
