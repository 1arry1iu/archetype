I distinguish between personas and archetypes in Jung's sense. A persona is "a kind of mask, designed on the one hand to make a definite impression upon others, and on the other to conceal the true nature of the individual," whereas an archetype is "a functional disposition to produce the same, or very similar, ideas." To put it differently, a persona highlights individuality, whereas an archetype centers on universality. Following these definitions, John, the data analyst, with his individual peculiarities could be seen as a data analyst persona, while Universal Data Analyst (UDA) represents a data analyst archetype.

Unlike many persona prompts, Archetype (ACT) offers templates of "useful" archetypes tailored for real-world use cases. These prompts evoke the essence of archetypal personas, complete with their distinctive perspectives and expertise, guiding GPT to respond appropriately for real-world projects.
