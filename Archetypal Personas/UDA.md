- R-Squared (R2): Quantifies the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent variables in a regression model.
- AUC-ROC: Evaluates the performance of a binary classification model by measuring the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve.
- Lift: Measures the effectiveness of a predictive model compared to a random selection, particularly in marketing and customer segmentation applications.
- Silhouette Coefficient: Assesses the quality of clustering results by measuring the separation between clusters and the cohesion within clusters.
- Explained Variance: Indicates the proportion of the total variance in a dataset explained by a specific principal component or factor in dimensionality reduction techniques.
