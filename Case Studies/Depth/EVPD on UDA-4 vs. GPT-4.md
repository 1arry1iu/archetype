In this case study, I explore how personas can be utilized to enhance the focus and perspectives of GPT. 

I fed the [Electric Vehicle Population Data](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data) to both UDA-4/GPT-4 and GPT-4. The prompts were the same except that there is no anchor prompt for GPT-4.

The prompts used were as follows:

- Please do some PhD-level stuff on the input data.
- Please proceed to the end without my supervision.

The result is interesting.

"John (UDA-4/GPT-4) scored particularly high in the depth of analysis and the use of statistical methods, while Mary (GPT-4) had broader coverage in her analysis. Both displayed high consistency, clarity, and validity in their findings."

This finding aligns with a previous observation I made regarding GPT's performance. When aiming for in-depth analysis, the use of anchor personas and CoT proves beneficial. On the other hand, when aiming for breadth, employing one-off prompts is more effective. Linguistically, this mirrors the approach people take when tackling complex issues. Initial "what" questions often yield broad responses, while subsequent "how" and "why" inquiries tend to generate specific, in-depth answers.
