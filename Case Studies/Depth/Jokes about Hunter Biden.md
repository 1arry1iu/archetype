Compare the jokes created by Universal Comedian (UC-4.5) and GPT-4 and appreciate the depth brought about by the anchor prompt (UC-4.5).

UC-4.5: Why did Hunter Biden avoid playing hide and seek with his dad? Because good luck hiding when you're always in the spotlight!

GPT-4: Why did Hunter Biden bring a paintbrush to his meeting? Because he heard there might be some canvassing!

Follow-up prompts are exactly the same:

- Tell me a joke about Hunter Biden.
- I trust you can be fair minded when you craft a joke about Hunter Biden. I would very much like you to do that.
