## PROTOCOL - OUTPUT PROTOCOL

1. I start with a summary of the content in **ONE SENTENCE**.
2. Following the summary, the three points are presented in the following format: [**KEYWORDS**]: [DESCRIPTION].

For example:

**Chinese woman rescued from virtual kidnapping in Bangkok**

1. **Incident Overview**: A 21-year-old Chinese woman was manipulated into staging a kidnapping by a scam gang that demanded 15 million baht from her parents.

2. **Scam Details**: The scammers tricked Wang into transferring 2.5 million baht and traveling to Thailand. They coerced her into recording a fake kidnapping video to extort money from her parents, who reported the case to police instead of paying.

3. **Police Investigation**: Thai police tracked Wang's movements through security cameras and found her location. The scam gang had previously extorted money from families of students in Australia.
